## Great Britain's Theater Market
![GB Goal vs Pledge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86166117/122711436-fb2bd780-d216-11eb-8837-02801e4e8090.png)
### Mean campaign goal is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
